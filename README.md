## Handle Async Data Loading, Lazy Loading, and Code Splitting with React Tutorial
My code that I wrote after learning from [a post on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-handle-async-data-loading-lazy-loading-and-code-splitting-with-react) about handling Handle Async Data Loading, Lazy Loading, and Code Splitting with React. This is vital to the survival as a React developer. What spawned me onto what to learn this is, a product I am working on, [MERNStackStarter](https://github.com/serafirim/MERNStackStarter), has states and I was confused about what was going on.
